Hybrid or multi-cloud adoption is the standard strategy most enterprises are following to innovate and improve resiliency, high availability, cost optimization, and/or to integrate with multiple applications. HashiCorp Packer is a cloud-agnostic tool that delivers a unique solution by letting you build identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single template file.

In this session, you'll learn how Packer is used to automate the management and delivery of golden images to Azure, AWS, and GCP. Images that can later be used by Terraform to create the required infrastructure to host applications in their respective cloud providers.
